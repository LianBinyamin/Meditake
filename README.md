Android app academic course project.
The app purpose is to help people get their medications organized and remember taking them by using notifications and having a contact which would get noticed if the user haven't reacted to a notification.
Also there is an option to the user to press on s.o.s button which will make a call to his contact in case an emergency occurred.
